# Virtual Pet Shelter

The VirtualPatShelterApp is a console app that will allow the user to interact with a Virtual Pet Shelter that houses multiple Virtual Pets.

Actions will change the attributes of the virtual pet and some attribute levels may have consequences.

Actions include:

1. Feed to feed all of the pets
2. Water to give water to all of the pets
3. Play with a single pet - allow for the user to choose a pet
4. Adopt a pet - this causes a pet to be removed
5. Admit a pet - allow the user to enter info an a net is created in the shelter
